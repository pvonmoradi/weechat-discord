I personally use weechat-discord with my alt account for testing and personal use and have not been banned _yet_.

### Installation

Binaries are automatically compiled for macOS and linux and archived on [Github Actions](https://terminal-discord.vercel.app/api/latest-build?repo=weechat-discord&workflow=1329556&branch=mk3&redirect)

On macOS you will need to [adjust the Weechat plugin file extensions](#macos)

#### Building

In order to build weechat-discord yourself you will need:

* A recent version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* Weechat developer libraries (optional)
* [libclang](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html)

Compiling with Cargo with result in a shared object file `target/release/libweecord.so` (or `.dylib` on macos), which
then needs to be installed to the `plugins/` directory of your weechat home.

This can be done automatically with the project build tool.

```
cargo xtask install
```

Other commands include:

* `cargo xtask test` - Builds and installs in a test directory
* `cargo xtask run` - Builds and installs globally for release
* `cargo xtask fmt` - Builds and formats the repo
* `cargo xtask` - Is the same as `cargo xtask test`

The global weechat home directory defaults to `~/.weechat` and can be changed by setting `WEECHAT_HOME` and the test
dir defaults to `./test_dir/` and can be changed by setting `WEECHAT_TEST_DIR`

#### Weechat headers

By default, the latest `weechat-plugin.h` file is used, however a system file can be used by setting
`WEECHAT_BUNDLED=false` and setting `WEECHAT_PLUGIN_FILE` to the absolute path of your `weechat-plugin.h` file.

#### Optional Features

Certain additional features can be enabled using cargo feature flags:
* `syntax_highlighting` - Enables syntax highlighting for code blocks (uses the amazing [syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect))
* `images` - Enable support for rendering images inline

Features can be enabled when using xtask by setting the `WEECORD_FEATURES` environment variable.

All features are enabled for Github Actions builds.

### Setup

You must first obtain a login token.

A Python script [`find_token.py`](find_token.py) is included in this repo which will attempt to find the tokens used by
installed Discord clients (both the webapp and desktop app should be searched).

The script will attempt to use [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) if installed to search faster.

If the script fails, you can get the tokens manually.

Open Devtools (ctrl+shift+i or cmd+opt+i) and navigate to Application tab > Local Storage on left > discordapp.com > "token".
Discord deletes the token once the page has loaded, so you will need to refresh the page and to grab it quickly
(disabling your network connection may allow you to grab it more easily).

Once you have your token you can run

```
/discord token 123456789ABCDEF
```

However, this saves your token insecurely in `$WEECHAT_HOME/weecord.conf`, so it is recommended you use [secure data](https://weechat.org/blog/post/2013/08/04/Secured-data).
If you saved your token as `discord_token` then you would run

```
/discord token ${sec.data.discord_token}
```

Once your token is set, you can reload the plugin with

```
/plugin reload weecord
```

### Configuration

#### Bar items
##### Typing indicator

The bar item `discord_typing` displays the typing status of the current buffer and can be appended to
`weechat.bar.status.items`.


##### Slowmode cooldown

The bar item `discord_slowmode_cooldown` displays the ratelimit time for the current channel.

#### Useful options

* `weecord.general.send_typing` - This must be set to true for others to see when you are typing


### Usage

#### Editing

Messages can be edited and deleted using ed style substitutions.

To edit the previous message:
```
s/foo/bar/
```

To delete the previous message:
```
s///
```

To select an older message, an offset can be included, for example, to delete the 3rd most recent message (sent by you):
```
3s///
```

### MacOS
Weechat does not search for macos dynamic libraries (.dylib) by default, this can be fixed by adding `.dylib`s to the plugin search path,

```
/set weechat.plugin.extension ".so,.dll,.dylib"
```

PRs are welcome.
Please ensure that the source is formatted by running `cargo xtask fmt` (the code builds on stable but uses nightly rustfmt).
